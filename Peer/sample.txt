Info in Single File Mode
For the case of the single-file mode, the info dictionary contains the following structure:

name: the filename. This is purely advisory. (string)
length: length of the file in bytes (integer)
md5sum: (optional) a 32-character hexadecimal string corresponding to the MD5 sum of the file. This is not used by BitTorrent at all, but it is included by some programs for greater compatibility.
Info in Multiple File Mode
For the case of the multi-file mode, the info dictionary contains the following structure:

name: the name of the directory in which to store all the files. This is purely advisory. (string)
files: a list of dictionaries, one for each file. Each dictionary in this list contains the following keys:
length: length of the file in bytes (integer)
md5sum: (optional) a 32-character hexadecimal string corresponding to the MD5 sum of the file. This is not used by BitTorrent at all, but it is included by some programs for greater compatibility.
path: a list containing one or more string elements that together represent the path and filename. Each element in the list corresponds to either a directory name or (in the case of the final element) the filename. For example, a the file "dir1/dir2/file.ext" would consist of three string elements: "dir1", "dir2", and "file.ext". This is encoded as a bencoded list of strings such as l4:dir14:dir28:file.exteInfo in Single File Mode
